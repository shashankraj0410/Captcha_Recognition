# Captcha_Recognition
This project focuses on captcha text recognition using CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network). It leverages deep learning techniques to accurately decode text from CAPTCHA images, which are commonly used for security verification.
📷 Dataset

We use the CAPTCHA Version 2 Images dataset from Kaggle.

Dataset Link: Kaggle - CAPTCHA Version 2 Images

The dataset contains a variety of CAPTCHA images with corresponding text labels.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (3.x)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (For deep learning model)

OpenCV (For image preprocessing)

NumPy & Pandas (For data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (For visualization)

🔥 Features

✔ Preprocessing of CAPTCHA images (grayscale conversion, thresholding, resizing).✔ Training a CRNN model for sequence-to-sequence text recognition.✔ Use of CTC Loss (Connectionist Temporal Classification) for sequence decoding.✔ Model evaluation and accuracy metrics.✔ Inference on new CAPTCHA images.

⚙ Installation

📊 Model Architecture

The CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) model consists of:

CNN Layers for feature extraction from images.

RNN Layers (LSTM/GRU) for sequential text processing.

CTC Loss Function for alignment-free text recognition.

🚀 Training the Model

Run the following command to train the model:

python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001

🎯 Testing and Inference

Use the trained model to recognize text from new CAPTCHA images:

python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.png

📌 Results & Performance

Achieved XX% accuracy on the test dataset.

Model is robust to various distortions in CAPTCHA images.

📜 Future Improvements

🔹 Improve data augmentation for better generalization.🔹 Experiment with Transformer-based models for better accuracy.🔹 Deploy as an API using Flask or FastAPI.
